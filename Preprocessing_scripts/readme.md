## Metadata Transformations

1. **Movie Title Transformation**: 
   - Extracts movie names by removing the release year from the title.
   - Extracts the release year from the title and saves it as a separate column.

2. **Extract Starring Actors**: 
   - Splits the starring actors' names into separate entries for better analysis.
   
3. **Extract Director**: 
   - Saves the director's names into a separate CSV file for further use.

4. **Remove Directors**: 
   - Removes the director column from the transformed metadata to streamline the dataset.

5. **Remove Starring**: 
   - Removes the starring column from the transformed metadata to focus on other data points.
